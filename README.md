# Resume

This repository provides an automated workflow for updating and hosting your resume online. It uses LaTeX to generate a PDF and GitHub Actions to automatically deploy the resume to GitHub Pages. Simply update the LaTeX file with your latest information, push the changes, and the updated resume will be reflected live on your website without any hassle.
